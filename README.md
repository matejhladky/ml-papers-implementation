# Machine Learning Papers Implementation
This repository contains documented implementations of influential machine learning papers. The aim is to reproduce the original methods as closely as possible in most cases while also highlighting the evolution of techniques from historical methods to modern practices.

## Progress
| Paper  | Note | Status |
|---|---|---|
|  Gradient Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition |  LeNet | Finished |
|  ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks | AlexNet | In Progress |
| Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition | ResNet | In Progress | 

More papers will be added soon.

## Install & Usage
Clone the repository, create a virtual env and install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Each notebook is self-contained and extensively documented.
